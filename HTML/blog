						<p>  I am passionate about dog training. I own a shiba inu, named Ace Ventura. He is a 2 and a half year old cream-colored shiba, 
							and while he won't win best in breed, he makes up for it by always keeping me on my toes and being a good hiking partner..</p>

				<aside> <h2 class=lavender> Things I like to do:</h2> 
																	
						<p>	 I am a huge horror movie buff, and I spend a lot of time watching terrible B rated monster films on netflix on rainy days. I am also an avid hiker,
							and have hiked part of the Pacific Coast Trail. I am a little disappointed because this summer I had hoped to hike it completely, but I figure that 
							is what next year is for! Either way, I am very happy to have a plethora of wonderful hiking trails nearby on the not-so-rainy days.  
							</p>
						
							
							My top three recommended films on netflix right now are: 
							<ol>
							<li> Housebound </li>
							<li> Witching and Bitching </li>
							<li> Tucker and Dale Vs. Evil </li></ol> 
							
							For monster movies, I recommend: 
							<ol>
							<li> Monsters </li>
							<li> Zombeavers </li>
							<li> Troll Hunter </li></ol> 
							
							
						<p>	Netflix has a huge selection of Nicholas Cage movies as well, so for fun I highly recommend checking out any of his films. They may not have a huge budget, but he does
							a great job committing to his roles to the point where, dare I say, he might be a National Treasure?
